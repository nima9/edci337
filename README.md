# EDCI 337 Site

This is a template for blogs called ["Blogster"](https://github.com/flexdinesh/blogster) with using the theme: **bubblegum**.

This Blog template uses [AstroJS](https://astro.build) for fast and lightweight website generation, [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) for beautiful and fast styling and [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev) for creating blogs quick and easy via an expanded version of markdown.

The purpose of this site is to spin up something really quick, nice looking and performant for my "Interactive & Multimedia Learning" class (EDCI 337) at the University of Victoria (rather than just using Wordpress).

I will be adding a plugin for a commenting system.

In other projects in the future, for practice and learning, I would not start with a template and make the site from the ground up.
