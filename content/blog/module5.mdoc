# The Generative AI Tool I picked

The Generative AI tool I picked is called "[v0](https://v0.dev)".

v0 had a sign up list in order to use it (and it still might be). It is a Generative AI tool that can create any UI via using Reactjs (a javascript library), shadcn (a very famous React UI library that is famous for 'only adding code to the UI components you need (rather than installing the entire UI library)'), and Tailwind (a CSS framework). So for example, you can type "create a landing page for my tomato farm business" and it will generate a visual/playable UI page along side with the Reactjs code used to make it. It is a very powerful tool and I actually have never used it (just signed up long time ago and forgot) and excited to use it for this module! v0 is made by "Vercel" which is a serverless hosting company that also have made their own App framework (that goes on-top of React) called Nextjs and they also help the React team at Facebook a lot with development.

## The prompt I used for v0:

The prompt I put into v0 was **"Create a homepage for a logged in user for a website that facilitates local gaming events"**.

The reason why I chose this prompt was because my roommates and I are actually re-making a better e-sports website (that can be used for big tournaments to small local gaming events). So far, people use a site called [start.gg](https://www.start.gg) but since it was bought out by Microsoft, it has been very buggy, not user friendly, and no added features the community has been asking for.

## Click the link below the screenshot to view the prompt on v0:

**Reference:** _"Create a homepage for a logged in user for a website that facilitates local gaming events" prompt. v0 by Vercel, 30 Mar. 2024, [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)_

You can see that it made 3 options for me (you are viewing the third option, the one I liked), and you can click the black button on the top right named "Code </>" to see the React code that was used to make the UI.

It's very well made, looks professional, and can actually be used as a starting point if I were to create this website. What's even better, the code is written very readable too!

# SECTIONS analysis on "v0"

S: The 'Students' would be able to access v0 (if they signed up). But if there is a waiting list for each student, then best not to use this tool.

E: The 'Ease of Use' is extremely high. You just type in a prompt and it generates a UI for you. It is very intuitive and easy to use.

C: The 'Cost' is free to use (if you signed up). There is a premium tier that could give better and faster UIs, but it is not necessary.

T: The 'Teaching' part is really up to how the teacher uses this tool for their course. It could be used for a SaaS entrepreneur course where the student's aren't coders and want to make nice, performant UIs for a website.
It could also be a good learning tool for how to use Reactjs, or how to use Tailwind, or how to use Shadcn. Since you can see examples of code being generated, and even ask the AI to make tiny adjustments in the UI to see the differences.
It is a very powerful tool that can be used in many ways.
But it could also be wrongly used to make a UI without coding (when perhaps the point of the course is to practice coding Reactjs).

I: 'Interaction' is unique. In the sense that it is meant for one user to use the tool. But you can copy the prompts you made and share it with others. It is not a collaborative tool, but it can be used in a collaborative setting.

O: For 'Organization', there would be some per-cautions since all the data inputted will be used by v0 (Vercel). I could also see a educational tier if an institution contacts Vercel to use this tool for their course.

N: For 'Networking', this is interesting because this could be really useful for intro UI/UX courses that have no coding pre-requisite (or start to learn how to code in the course).

S: For 'Security', I would be a bit worried about the data that is being inputted into the tool since it all goes to Vercel. Also, all prompts made are public to everyone, but there is a "make private" toggle that can be used.

# Reflection Question:

##### "Try out creating an H5P interactivity using ChatGPT â€“ what did it help with and what needs adjusting?"

I created my own little "Mouse Aim Trainer" using ChatGPT, but since I can't use H5P, I told ChatGPT to make it use SvelteJS.
It went extremely well! I was able to make a simple game where you have to aim your mouse at a target and click it.

You can play the game here: [Mouse Aim Trainer](/aim-trainer)

It was almost perfect. The only problem would be for users using my blog on "light mode", they wouldn't be able to see the white dots, so I added some code to make the dots black if on light mode, and changed the color of the dots on light mode to green.
I am quite surprised of how well, and this has helped me learn more SvelteJS at the same time! I just have to be proactive and not use this to avoid learning.
